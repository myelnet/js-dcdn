title: Myel.js Feature Roadmap
description: Get a preview of upcoming features and improvements coming soon!.
---

The Myel CDN is highly experimental and is likely to evolve a lot over the next few years before we stabilize the protocol around an optimal implementation.

## Browser retrievals

Currently Myel.js requires HTTP and Websocket JSON RPC endpoints to communicate with a Myel node. In the future, client nodes will run in browsers directly and retrieve content directly from edge node.

## Sponsored retrievals

In the latest implementation, data transfers are paid by the Myel node used as gateway. We plan to allow whitelisted nodes to retrieve content sponsored by a 3rd party.

We have more potential features in the work and this roadmap is subject to change. If there's anything you'd like us to prioritize please open an issue on our Github and we'll respond to it ASAP.
