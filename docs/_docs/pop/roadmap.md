title: Roadmap
description: Get a preview of upcoming features and improvements coming soon!

The Myel CDN is highly experimental and is likely to evolve a lot over the next few years before we stabilize the protocol around an optimal implementation.

## Economics

We're currently experimenting with different economic incentives for running a Myel node. Upon launching our incentive programs, individuals running pop on their devices will be compensated by receiving FIL from random retrieval deals.

## Monitoring

Once the protocol is more stable, a monitoring dashboard will be available to inspect pop economic performance and ressource usage. We hope this will bring more transparency into how the system operates and encourage more people to join our community and run some pops.

We have more potential features in the work and this roadmap is subject to change. If there's anything you'd like us to prioritize please open an issue on our [Github](https://github.com/myelnet/pop) and we'll respond to it ASAP.
