The Myel CDN is highly experimental and is likely to evolve a lot over the next few years before we stabilize the protocol around an optimal implementation.

## Browser retrievals

Currently Myel.js requires HTTP endpoints to communicate with a Myel node. In the future, client nodes will run in browsers directly and retrieve content directly from edge node.

## Sponsored retrievals

In the latest implementation, data transfers are paid by the Myel node used as gateway. We plan to allow whitelisted nodes to retrieve content sponsored by a 3rd party.
