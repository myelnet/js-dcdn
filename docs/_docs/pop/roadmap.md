The Myel CDN is highly experimental and is likely to evolve a lot over the next few years before we stabilize the protocol around an optimal implementation.
For an up to date view of our roadmap, and features we are currently developing, head to the "roadmap" section of [myel.network](https://www.myel.network/).


If there's anything you'd like for us to prioritize please open an issue on our [Github](https://github.com/myelnet/pop) and we'll respond to it ASAP.
